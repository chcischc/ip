## Error Handling  

Capybara handles errors gracefully:  
- If a command is unknown, you will see:  
  ```
  OOPS!!! I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means :-(
  ```  
- If a description is missing:  
  ```
  Peep! todo needs a description. Try: todo sleep ...
  ```  
- If a deadline or event is missing a date/time:  
  ```
  Sniff sniff‚Ä¶ Your deadline needs a time! Try: deadline nap /by 2025-09-01
  ```  

---

## Saving and Loading  

- Tasks are **automatically saved** to `Data/taskStorage.txt`.  
- On restart, Capybara will load your saved tasks.
